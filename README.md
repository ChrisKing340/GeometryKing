# GeometryKing
C++ Classes for 2D and 3D geometry 

Generic code base inteded for 64 Bit Windows 10 and SIMD support from DirectXMath.  Compiled with Visual Studio 2019.

GeometryKing contains the base SIMD data types class wrappers to seamlessly accelerate your code. From this base, GeometryKing defines geometry types and methods that make the basis of 2D and 3D games, simulators, and engineering applications.  

Not that this code base builds into a fully functional DirectX 12 game engine and physics simulator of mine.  The classes here are not dependent on any graphics API and intended to be generic without rendering methods.  My graphics render classes inherit from my model class, for example, to add that functionality.
